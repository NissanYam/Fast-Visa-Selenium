Today there is a ×‘ongestion on the embassy and you get an appointment available at least six months ahead.
That's why I created this app that searches for an earlier date than the existing date for an appointment at the embassy.

First you must register this site and get an appointment at the US Embassy https://ais.usvisa-info.com/en-il/niv/users/sign_in

By filling in details in the json file, the software will search for an earlier queue than the existing queue.
